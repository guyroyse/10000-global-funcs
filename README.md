# Just Eggs

I know this code sucks. That is the point.

This codebase represents a sample legacy JavaScript application that is to be
used during my jQuery and 10,000 Global Functions talks. Of course, you are
free to use it for other things. Like a refactoring exercise or target
practice.

Enjoy! ðŸ’©
